# 👋 Hi! 

## 🎮 About Me
I'm Satang, but my full name is Jidapa Petchkamnerd and I'm Thai.
<br> I am studying in the School of Information Technology and Innovation, majoring in Game and Interactive Media at Bangkok University.
<br> I enjoy learning new technologies, experimenting with game mechanics, and improving my skills.
<br> I am a Unity game developer passionate about creating games that are not only fun but also meaningful.  
I believe that games can be powerful tools for learning, problem-solving, and personal growth.  
My goal is to develop experiences that **engage, educate, and inspire** players while keeping them entertained.
