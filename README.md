<br> I am studying in the School of Information Technology and Innovation, majoring in Game and Interactive Media at Bangkok University.
<br> I enjoy learning new technologies, experimenting with game mechanics, and improving my skills.

### 🍔**Fast Food** : 2D Nightmare Calories Platformer — 2025
**Role:** Main Unity Developer | **Genre:** 2D Platformer, Survival Escape | **Features:** Weight Machanic, Trap-Based Level Design, Item Choices
<br>**Status:** Playable prototype (core gameplay complete, SFX and additional levels planned)
**Tech:** Unity, C#
<br>**Description:** a 2D platformer where players must escape a dream world filled with dangerous food traps. I proposed and designed the core concept: food influences the character’s body and abilities. Consuming junk food causes the character to become heavier and slower, while healthy food makes the character more agile. This mechanic is not only fun but also delivers a subtle educational message about the impact of nutrition.
<br>**Responsibility:**
- Proposed the core idea and designed key mechanics based on food effects
- Implemented player movement and interaction with hazards using C#
- Created custom animations and transitions that reflect the character’s changing body shape
- Developed UI and feedback system to reflect player condition
- Integrated Unity Analytics to track player behavior and session data

### 🪅My First and Only 3D Low-Poly Model I’m Proud Of — 2024
**Course:** GI231 — 3D Modeling (Year 3, Semester 2)
<br> **Tool:** Maya  |  **Style:** Low Poly
- I took this class out of curiosity—I wanted to explore what 3D modeling would be like. It seemed fun at first, but once I started working on the project, I realized that it wasn’t my strength. Even so, I committed to finishing it with my best effort.
This experience taught me about my own limits, helped me discover what I don’t enjoy, and reminded me that dedication matters even when the path gets tough.
