# 👋 Hi! 

## 🎮 About Me
I'm Satang, but my full name is Jidapa Petchkamnerd and I'm Thai.
<br> I am studying in the School of Information Technology and Innovation, majoring in Game and Interactive Media at Bangkok University.
<br> I enjoy learning new technologies, experimenting with game mechanics, and improving my skills.
> I am a Unity game developer passionate about creating games that are not only fun but also meaningful.  
I believe that games can be powerful tools for learning, problem-solving, and personal growth.  
My goal is to develop experiences that **engage, educate, and inspire** players while keeping them entertained.

### 🪅My First and Only 3D Low-Poly Model I’m Proud Of
**Course:** GI231 — 3D Modeling (Year 3, Semester 2)
<br> **Tool:** Maya  |  **Style:** Low Poly
- I took this class out of curiosity—I wanted to explore what 3D modeling would be like. It seemed fun at first, but once I started working on the project, I realized that it wasn’t my strength. Even so, I committed to finishing it with my best effort.
This experience taught me about my own limits, helped me discover what I don’t enjoy, and reminded me that dedication matters even when the path gets tough.
