# Hi! 

## About Me🧃
### 🍒Who I Am
I’m Satang (Jidapa Petchkamnerd), a Thai student currently studying Game and Interactive Media at the School of Information Technology and Innovation, Bangkok University.

### ⭐My Passion
I’m a Unity game developer passionate about building games that are not only fun to play but also meaningful. I believe that games can be more than entertainment — they can be tools for learning, reflection, and personal growth.

### 💻What I Love Doing
I enjoy exploring new technologies, experimenting with gameplay mechanics, and constantly improving my skills through hands-on projects. My goal is to create interactive experiences that engage, educate, and inspire players.

## 🎮 Featured Projects

<br>a survival-themed card-based board game set in a harsh, unforgiving winter. Each player takes on the role of a fragile matchstick fighting to survive through snowstorms, icy winds, and brutal challenges with only a handful of resources.

### 🪅My First and Only 3D Low-Poly Model I’m Proud Of — 2024
**Course:** GI231 — 3D Modeling (Year 3, Semester 2)
<br> **Tool:** Maya  |  **Style:** Low Poly
- I took this class out of curiosity—I wanted to explore what 3D modeling would be like. It seemed fun at first, but once I started working on the project, I realized that it wasn’t my strength. Even so, I committed to finishing it with my best effort.
This experience taught me about my own limits, helped me discover what I don’t enjoy, and reminded me that dedication matters even when the path gets tough.
